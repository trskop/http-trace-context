-- | Low-level representation of @traceparent@ and @tracestate@ headers. Idea
-- here is to provide intermediate representation that is close to the actual
-- representation. Module "Network.HTTP.TraceContext" then provides more user
-- friendly representation. This should allow us to easily extend\/optimise
-- in the future without breaking API too much.
--
-- Another benefit, of having this data type, is that in case of proxies we may
-- want to do as little parsing and interpretation as possible while being able
-- to log the relevant information. This data type should be used for such
-- purposes instead of the user-friendly one. Rendering (of this data type) is
-- not required in case of pass-through proxies as the values should be passed
-- unmodified. Only exception to that is "restart tracing" scenario.
--
-- Simplified grammar of @traceparent@ and @tracestate@ headers in ABNF
-- (Augmented Backus-Naur Form notation
-- <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234 RFC5234>):
--
-- > traceparent = version "-" trace-id "-" parent-id "-" trace-flags
-- > tracestate = key "=" value 0*31("," key "=" value )
--
-- Please, be aware that the above grammar is oversimplification intended to
-- help to understand this data type. Trace Context standard needs to be
-- consulted for details.
--
-- Reason why values from @traceparent@ and @tracestate@ values are combined is
-- because even systems that do not use @tracestate@ value are required to pass
-- it along to subsequent calls and it SHOULD be in a normalised form.

    -- The logic described by the standard is pretty complicated and we may
    -- want to implement the most important bits of it first:
    --
    -- * Prune empty values as their purpose is to simplify generation.
    -- * Apply 32 entries limitation.
    -- * One item per key limitation.
    --
    -- Things for later:
    --
    -- * Maximum size limit. (Make it configurable?)
    -- * Logic for pruning entries when maximum size has been reached. This
    --   requires starting with long entries first. See standard.
